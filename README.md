Voltage Regulators (Line and Adjustable)

Line Voltage Regulator:
datasheet: 
  https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/MCP1700-Data-Sheet-20001826F.pdf
purpose: 
  This allows you to get an array of common voltages that you need to power your microprocessor and components without having to adjust the voltage regulator. 
design:
  This degin takes a nine volt battery and that goes into a voltage divider to give you 5 volt. it is done with a 1.2k resistor and a 1.5k resistor. Then it goes into a voltage regulator through a .47u farad capacitor that outputs a steady 3.3 volts. On the output of the 3.3volt regulator is a 33uF capacitor. 
Import: 
  To import the design into your schematic just download the .dch file. Then copy the design into the new schematic by highlighting over it.

Adjustable Voltage Regulator:
